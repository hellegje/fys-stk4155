    "Develop a logistic regression code and compare to FFNN.\n",

    "(Lecture notes week 39 and 40 contain examples it is ok to use)\n",
    "### 1: plain gradient descent with fixed learning rate (tune it) using the analytical expression for the gradient\n",
    "### 2: Add momentum to the plain GD code and compare convergence with a fixed learning rate (may need to tune it). Keep using the analytical expression for the gradient\n",
    "### 3: Repeat these steps for stochastic gradient descent with mini batches and a given number of epochs. Use a tunable learning rate (lectures week 39 and 40). Discuss the results as functions of the various parameters (size of batches, nr of epochs etc). Use the analytical gradient\n",
    "### 4: Implement the adagrad method in order to tune the learning rate. Do this with and without momentum for plain gradient descent and SGD\n",
